I am a graduate student developing multi-fluid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations for Europa's plasma interaction with Jupiter's magnetosphere with my advisors, [Xianzhe Jia](https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/people/xianzhe-jia/) and [James A. Slavin](https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/people/james-a-slavin/). Interaction between Jupiter's magnetospheric plasma and Europa's ionospheric plasma generates current systems and magnetic fields near the moon. With multi-fluid MHD we can represent the most important plasma populations in the interaction and better understand the role they play in producing these magnetic signatures. <strong>The goal for my dissertation research is to develop a comprehensive model for Europa's variable plasma interaction which can be used to study Europa's space environment.</strong>

Europa: a small moon in a big magnetosphere
======
[Jupiter](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/) orbits the Sun from 490 million miles away, 5 times the distance between the Sun and the Earth, completing an orbit once every 12 years on Earth. Just as the planets orbit the Sun, a host of moons orbits Jupiter, the largest of which are the Galilean moons Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Europa orbits Jupiter at 419 thousand miles, or 9.4 Jupiter Radii (R<sub>J</sub>).

Jupiter is the biggest and the strongest planet in the Solar System in many ways, but especially with respect to plasma and magnetic fields. Jupiter produces a magnetic moment 20,000 times stronger than the Earth’s geomagnetic moment. The influence of this magnetic field extends outward from Jupiter, forming a roughly tear-drop shaped region called the magnetosphere. The shape of the magnetosphere is governed by the solar wind breaking against Jupiter's magnetic field and plasma. Jupiter’s magnetosphere can be 100s of R<sub>J</sub> wide and can extend 7,000 R<sub>J</sub> long, long enough to stretch out to the orbit of Saturn.

The Galilean moons orbit within the magnetosphere. Io, the innermost moon orbiting at 5.9 R<sub>J</sub>, is pock-marked with volcanoes that release 1 ton of material into the magnetosphere every second. Europa, at 9.4 R<sub>J</sub>, is bathed in the plasma generated from this volcanic ejecta.

Europa is the smallest of the Galilean moons and is largely believed to possess a subsurface global ocean beneath its outer layer of ice. Because the ocean has not been directly observed the thickness of the icy shell and the depth and salinity of the ocean are not yet known. Evidence of the ocean mainly comes from observations of the magnetic fields near Europa by [the Galileo Mission](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/galileo/in-depth/).

Modeling Europa’s space environment
------
Space plasmas are composed of electrically charged particles suspended on the magnetic fields that fill the Solar system. At Europa these charged particles are typically electrons and ions of Oxygen and Sulfur, with other species present in much smaller quantities. In addition to the plasma from Jupiter’s magnetosphere, cooler plasma is generated at Europa from Europa’s atmosphere. Magnetospheric washes over Europa to swirl and break against this cooler plasma. The interaction between these different plasma populations generates electrical currents which perturb the local magnetic fields. <strong>The aim of my dissertation research is to develop an adaptable computational model which can represent this complex plasma interaction and all its variability in response to the changing conditions of the magnetosphere as well as variations in Europa's atmosphere.</strong>

Many space plasmas can be effectively modeled as if the ensemble of discrete charged particles was a continuous charged fluid. This mathematical approximation is known as magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). MHD modeling of space plasmas is an area of rich, active research spanning many research groups across the world. At the University of Michigan, the [Center for Space Environment Modeling](http://csem.engin.umich.edu/) has developed the MHD code BATS-R-US. With the advanced computing capabilities provided by modern supercomputers, BATS-R-US has been used to effectively model large, complex space plasma systems such as the magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn, as well as the interaction between comets and the solar wind. We have used BATS-R-US to develop our model for Europa’s plasma interaction.

A similar MHD model for Europa’s plasma interaction has already helped to find [evidence for water plumes](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/old-data-reveal-new-evidence-of-europa-plumes). This multi-fluid model will focus on discerning the roles of different plasma populations in the interaction.

What’s Next?
------
One application for this model is to help determine the properties of Europa’s subsurface ocean. When the Galileo spacecraft observed the magnetic fields near Europa they found evidence for an induced magnetic field generated by electrical currents in Europa’s conducting ocean. The properties of the ocean which produce it can be determined by characterizing that magnetic field more precisely. However, the induced magnetic field was measured in the presence of magnetic signatures of the plasma interaction. Because the plasma interaction magnetic fields are variable, untangling them from the induced field is a complicated task.

NASA’s upcoming [Europa Clipper Mission](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/europa-clipper/) seeks to use Europa’s induced field to learn the properties of the subsurface ocean. By developing a sophisticated MHD model for the plasma interaction we will be able to predict how the plasma interaction magnetic fields will interfere with the induced magnetic fields, enabling the induced field to be identified in Europa Clipper’s magnetometer data.
